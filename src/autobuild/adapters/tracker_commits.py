"""The repository-state rules for a tracker that commits its own changes.

A self-committing tracker (Pinax 0.2.1 or later) appends its event and commits
it in the same command. These checks read the repository after such a command
and refuse any state that breaks the evidence chain. A tracker that leaves its
change uncommitted is detected here from the repository state, never from a
version string.
